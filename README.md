# Project-2201

# Notes on Data Sources
# Our project aims to compare pollution numbers in cities with increasing numbers of electric vehicles.   
# We collected our data from Kaggle, a community for data science. 
# Our data was pulled directly from government websites as CSV files.
# One restriction of our data is if a vehicle is sold or is no longer on the road in the given area.
