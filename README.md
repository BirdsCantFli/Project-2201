# Project-2201

# Walk through of data pulling 
We sifted through all current washington EV registrations and sorted by city.
Once we got the number of registered EVs we compared it to the total number of registered vehicle in the given city.
We also compiled the overall annual air quality index for each given city going back to 2017.

# Walk through of data cleaning
Both of the files where csv files, which made them easy to work on.
We ran into no restrictions for the data collecting.
We were able to download the data with no issues, and did not have to contact the owner for access.

# Reflection of visualisations
We wanted to put a focus on the different amounts of air pollution and the amount of EV cars in each city so we made graphs to clearly show each one.

# Storytelling/Insights 
We wanted to tell the real story about how effective Ev cars are. We found out that they are not as effective as the media makes it out to seem. While the car itself does not produce any emissions they still indirectly create air pollution. So while they are more effective than ICE it is not a massive change.
